# Balboa GL ML Spa Control

While there is the excellent https://github.com/ccutrer/balboa_worldwide_app project that handled the new WiFi capable BP range of controllers, their project is *NOT* compatible with the older GL/EL range such as the GL2000, GL2001 or EL2000 - This one is.

The aim of this project is to achieve similar Home Assistant integration as the app from ccutrer - we are about 95% of the way there

If you have the Balboa GS series please try - https://github.com/MagnusPer/Balboa-GS510SZ
